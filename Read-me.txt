This is the Frontend and Backend code of Uni chat 


I have use DBMONGO and CLOUDINARY for database.
I have use socket.io for bi-directional communication


For Ui (Tailwind and DaisyUI)


To start the backend server : npm run dev in Backend 
To start the Frontend : npm run dev in Frontend


Structure and UI is build by ME (DEV PATEL) 


You can use this code for educational purpose (don't copy and past , Learn and Implement)
